    <h2>Why Study Non-Conceptive Sex?</h2>
    <p>
      In many primates, sex is not only about reproduction. Individuals will
      engage in sexual behaviors not within fertile periods, in same sex
      partnerships, during pregnancy, and when sex is not possible.
      This is known as non-conceptive sex. In studying it, we can
      better understand how sex is used in social relationships
      in reducing tension, in building alliances, and in competition.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions of Sex Beyond Reproduction</h2>
    <p>
      Lectures 21–23 from Professor Knott show that sex has 
      many evolutionary functions. Some include things like
      attracting mates, showing fertility, creating friendships, trading
      for resources, and reducing aggression. In animals where the social life
      is intense, sex can be a great tool used for maintaining relationships,
      not just as a way to create offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is especially obvious in bonobos, where sexual behavior usually 
      happens in situations that are not related to reproduction. Things like 
      greeting, reconciliation, or bond formation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Patterns Across Apes and Monkeys</h2>
    <p>
      Furuichi, Connor, and Hashimoto go over non-conceptive sexual behavior
      in primates and have found that it is quite widespread. This behavior
      includes genital rubbing, mounting, genital-genital contact, or sexual
      play. These actions are usually used to reduce tension, strengthen
      alliances, or maintain social cohesion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point here is that sexual behavior is structured by fertility
      cycles AND by individuals’ social environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Chimpanzee Sociosexual Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Sandel and Reddy (2021) looked at same-sex sociosexual interactions in
      chimpanzees and found that this behavior is fairly rare and does not strongly
      correlate with dominance rank. This is a bit different from other forms of
      chimpanzee social life, where rank plays a big role.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also found that unlike bonobos, chimps do not use sociosexual behavior
      as a way to lessen group tension or easing aggression. The function might 
      not be as clear as it is for bonobos.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Non-Conceptive Sex and Paternity Confusion</h2>
    <p>
      In many primates, females will use sex as a way to manage male behavior.
      By mating with many partners, females are able to create paternity confusion.
      The point of it is to simply make all the male chimps unsure if the female's
      offspring is also theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This greatly reduces the risk of infanticide. Males who
      think they might be the father of a female's offspring
      are much less likely to kill the infant. This is a counter-
      strategy to males committing infanticide. When a female's
      infant is killed, they return to estrus sooner, so are able to
      reproduce quicker. It is in the male's interest to commit 
      infanticide IF they believe they are not the father.
    </p>

    <h2>Concealed Ovulation in Humans</h2>
    <p>
      Van Schaik shows that two things stand out with us humans.
      Concealed ovulation and extended sexual receptivity.
      Because it is hard to tell when women are fertile,
      sexuality is possible throughout a woman's cycle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This highlights how humans are different from other primates, who are
      more tied to signs of fertility. The combo of concealed ovulation and 
      extended receptivity are what creates our human mating system and 
      what influences the dynamics of a long term relationship.

    <h2>Why Non-Conceptive Sex Matters for Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      When sexuality is useful for social life, it can have
      effects on cooperation, alliances, parental care, and group dynamics.
      In primates, sex is a powerful tool for so many things, like reducing conflict, 
      securing partners, gaining support, and maintaining cohesion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For humans, this means that sex is deeply rooted in the evolution of
      long term pair bonds and the social environment that makes us special.
