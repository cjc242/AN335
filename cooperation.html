    <h2>Why Cooperation Is Hard to Explain</h2>
    <p>
      Cooperation seems natural for us, but evolutionarily it’s a bit of a puzzle. Whenever
      one individual helps another, they pay a cost while the partner gets the benefit.
      This means that cooperation shouldn't be a thing, unless there are reasons that 
      make helping worthwhile in the end. Understanding how primates solve this issue 
      can help us to understand how our strange human cooperation might work.

    <h2>How Primates Cooperate</h2>
    <p>
      Primates cooperate through grooming, coalitionary support, territorial defense,
      food sharing, and group hunting, to name a few. These behaviors aren’t them being nice just 
      to be nice. They must work into an evolutionary benefit.
      Some Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kin selection:</strong> helping relatives boosts inclusive fitness.</li>
      <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> long term partners benefit each other over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutualism:</strong> individuals get benefits by cooperating together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chimpanzees are a great example, as our closest cousin. They hunt together, form coalitions, and occasionally share food.
      Their cooperation seems to be a bit selective. It works the best with tolerant individuals
      who have established relationships, and stops working when there's intolerant individuals. 
      In fact, experiments have shown that a lot of chimp pairs do not cooperate well together because of this.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>What Chimps Teach Us About The Limits of Cooperation</h2>
    <p>
      In chimpanzees, the “tit-for-tat” reciprocity is rare.
      Helping is dependant, usually, on whether the other individual is asking for help, when the interaction does not involve food,
      or when there are clear benefits in that moment. What this means is that cooperation in chimps is 
      a real thing, but is situational. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is important to note, because it shows how different chimpanzees are from humans when it comes to cooperation. With 
      chimps being a lot more selective, tending to go for familiar partners when choosing to help, unlike humans who 
      can be willing to help complete strangers.
    </p>

    <h2>Humans as Mega Cooperators</h2>
    <p>
      Humans cooperate with family and close partners, of course, but they also do so with unrelated individuals,
      large groups, and complete strangers. This seems obvious to us, but it is worth noting how evolutionarily rare this is.
      Here are a few ways this shows up in humans:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cooperative breeding:</strong> human infants usually need care from many people, which
          may have selected for a higher tolerance, responsiveness, and motivation to help.</li>
      <li><strong>Prosocial motivations:</strong> fairness, empathy, and reputation seem
          to be much more important in humans than in other primates. People care how they are percieved,
      and change their behavior because of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Strong reciprocity:</strong> humans reward cooperators and punish cheaters,
          even at personal cost. Humans have evolved to rely on cooperation so much, that we have
          developed ways to keep cooperation stable in large groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Behaviors like these are what make it possible for humans
      to create large, cooperative societies that go far beyond what other
      primates have.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Cooperation, Morality, and Human Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      As cooperation became more important for our survival, humans created norms
      about how people should treat one another. Some argue that this is what contributed 
      to our self-domestication. The selection against individuals who are very reactive or aggressive
      and for individuals who are more tolerant. In animals, therefore in humans too, this creates a more
      socially attuned individual.
    <p>
      Cooperation, then, isn’t a strategy that is unique to humans, but it is our defining behavior because
      of how we have developed it.
