    <h2>What Are Preferred and Fallback Foods?</h2>
    <p>
      Primates don’t just eat whatever is around. They have preferred foods,
      which are high quality, meaning higher in calories and nutrients. They are chosen more often than you’d expect
      given how available they are. They also have fallback foods, which are low quality, meaning lower overall
      calories. These fallback foods, though, are much more abundant that preferred ones, which makes them important
      for survival during periods of low availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preferred foods, to summarize, are high in energy and easy to digest, but harder to find.
      Fallback foods are usually on the tougher side, being more fibrous and harder to process. But they are
      reliable during bad times. This sets up an important ecological trade off,
      how do you adapt to deal with feast and famine?

    <h2>Ape Diets Under Scarcity</h2>
    <p>
      Apes are a good example of this trade off. Chimpanzees are “ripe fruit specialists”.
      This means that when fruit is plentiful, they spend a lot of their time eating it. 
      When fruit becomes less common, they change their diet back into more fallback foods,
      like leaves and pith. Orangutans and gorillas rely even more on these fallback foods
      especially during scarcer times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because fruit can be patchy and unpredictable, apes must deal with swings in
      energy intake. In good times they can bulk up on food, while in bad times they have to
      slow down, travel less, and rely on whatever fat reserves they may have and on those
      low quality fallback foods.
    </p>

    <h2>How Fallback Foods Change Bodies and Brains</h2>
    <p>
      Marshall and Wrangham present the idea that preferred and fallback foods affect evolution by pushing it in
      different directions. Preferred foods call for adaptations in finding and harvesting food. These adaptations
      include things like larger brains, better spatial memory, color vision, and tool use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallback foods go the other way, preferring adaptations for processing tough, low-quality items.
      Adaptations that help with this include a thicker enamel, larger guts, and sometimes larger
      body size. Animals that rely mostly on fibrous fallback diets tend to show these traits a lot more
      often than those that specialize in a higher quality diet.

    <h2>Fallback Foods, Competition, and Cooperation</h2>
    <p>
      Fallback foods don’t just affect the physical. They are an important factor of social life.
      When fallback foods are plenty and widespread, feeding competition
      should be lower, meaning that larger groups may be able to coexist without
      constantly fighting over food. Without fallback foods,
      individuals might have to spread out more, making competition 
      over preferred foods more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      For humans, the idea of fallback foods is a great point in how cooperation serves as a buffer.
      Sharing and cooperative foraging is what allows people to survive bad
      seasons without relying on what only they themselves can get.
